# node-sync-copy

## Description

A small project which I created to sort files alphabetically and copy them synchronously without relaying on OS async batch file copying.

## Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Start project

```
node index.js {input folder} {output folder}
```

example:

```
node index.js ./input ./output
```
